# CLUSTERING REGENCIES IN EAST JAVA BASED ON SOCIAL INDICATOR

The dataset includes multidimensional social indicator variablesâ€”Population, Life Expectancy, Human Life Span, Average Years of Schooling, Birth Rate, Expenditure per Capita, Open Unemployment Rate, Gross Regional Domestic Product, Human Development Index.
